### Architecture

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />
</div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
</div>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the UI Component" />
</div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `patient` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a patient).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the patients' data i.e., all `patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePatientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `patient` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `patient` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both the patients' data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementations of Key Features**

This section describes detailed implementation notes for  the `add` feature
(A Patient Management Feature) to help you gain a 
better understanding of CareConnect.

### Add feature
The `add` feature enables users to add new patients to the patient list.

#### Execution flow

1. User inputs the command to create a new patient
2. A `LogicManager` object is called to execute the command
3. The `LogicManager` object calls the `parseCommand` method of an `addressBookParser` object to parse the user's input
4. The `addressBookParser` matches the command, identifying the `add` command's `Command Word` (which is `add`),
   and thus creates an `addCommandParser`.
5. The `parse` method of that `addCommandParser` object is called, which parses
   the user's input and returns an `addCommand` object to the `addressBookParser` object.
6. This `addCommand` is then returned to the `LogicManager` object, which calls the `execute` method 
   in the `addCommand` object, passing in a `model` object.
7. In the `execute` method, the `addPatient` method of the `model` is called, which adds a patient to the `model`.
8. The command finishes executing, and a success message is displayed.

### [Proposed] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current AddressBook state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous AddressBook state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone AddressBook state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial AddressBook state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single AddressBook state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient book. The 
`delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the AddressBook.
after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted AddressBook state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified AddressBook state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the AddressBook state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous AddressBook state, and restores the AddressBook to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the AddressBook to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest AddressBook state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the 
patient book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all AddressBook states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire patient list.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementations of each command are correct.

## **Appendix:Planned Enhancements**

### The team size is **5**.

### 1.) \[Enhancement\] Input Validation for `find`

Currently, there is no input validation for the `find` command. This means that an input such as
> `find &^%$*&!%$(*&`

would be accepted despite it not being possibly part of any name.

Another possible confusion is if the `/strict` prefix were mistyped as `strict/`, causing an input such as
> `find strict/ Homura`

to instead search for the names `strict/` and `Homura` not strictly rather than searching `Homura` strictly

A future update could parse the input and give an error message to the user when an invalid search name is entered.

### 2.) \[Enhancement\] Duplicate Detection for `add`

Currently, CareConnect compares strings case insensitively. However, it still takes into account spaces.

This means that names such as "Akemi Homura" and "Akemi &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homura" count as different people
even though they likely should refer to the same person.

We could add a check that splits the name by whitespace and compares the parts case-insensitively, then give a warning to the user if a potential duplicate is found.

### 3.) \[Enhancement\] Non-ambiguous `untag t/all` or `unprescribe m/all`

Currently, there is some slight ambiguity in these delete all functions. They could be interpreted as
removing the tag "all" or removing the medicine "all".

It is very unlikely that a user would create a tag named "all" or prescribe a medicine "all", since they don't
mean anything in the context of a patient under the care of a social worker.

However, removing this ambiguity would still be preferable. This could be done by making them
entirely separate commands like `untagAll` and `unprescribeAll`, or making the keyword to trigger
the deletion not a valid tag/medicine so there is no ambiguity such as `untag t/[ALL]` and
`unprescribe m/[ALL]` since `[` and `]` are not valid characters for tags and medicines.

### 4.) \[Enhancement\] Renaming internal uses of `addressBook` to `careConnect`

Currently, many internal functions and classes still reference `addressBook`, which is why most of the Developer Guide
still references `addressBook`. In the future, we hope to replace instances of `addressBook` with `CareConnect`, to
better reflect `CareConnect`'s status as separate from `addressBook`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Appendix: Effort

CareConnect is a significant extension of the AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) base project. While AB3 operates on a single `Person` entity, CareConnect supports a model involving multiple interconnected entities:
`Patient`, `Tag`, `Medicine`, and `VisitHistory`.
The effort required to design, implement, and polish these features demanded considerably more design planning, code refactoring, testing, and documentation.

---

### Difficulty Level & Challenges Faced

- **Multi-entity Data Model**: One of the biggest design shifts was moving from AB3's flat `Person` model to a relational structure. Each `Patient` could have multiple `Tags`, `Medicines`, and optionally a `Last Visit` date. This required the creation of `UniqueTagList`, bidirectional references, deduplication logic, and additional parsing and serialization layers.

- **Feature Granularity & Complexity**: The team implemented granular commands such as `untag`, `unprescribe`, and `delLastVisit` â€” each with nuanced logic and edge cases. Features like `untag INDEX t/all` or `find /strict` needed custom parsing logic and well-defined behavioral constraints to avoid ambiguity.

- **Robust CLI-Driven Input Design**: The command-line interface was not only feature-rich, but also robust against invalid inputs. Input requirements such as strictly formatted dates, unique (case-insensitive) names, and custom validation for phone/email/medicine/tag types ensured reliability and prevented user confusion.

- **Interactive JavaFX GUI**: The GUI was developed to provide a clean, informative interface while remaining reactive to CLI inputs. Changes in model state (e.g., tag removal, patient deletion) were automatically reflected in the UI through observable bindings.

- **Undo/Redo with Entity State**: The inclusion of `Undo` and `Redo` required the development of a `VersionedAddressBook` that could store and restore complex model states. Given the expanded data relationships, the effort to correctly snapshot and rollback patient changes was substantial.

- **User-Centered Design**: The app was designed with social workers in mind â€” users who are domain experts but not necessarily tech-savvy. Thus, the command syntax, field naming, help documentation, and error messages were all carefully written to be intuitive and context-appropriate.

---

### Project Effort

This project went through several development phases:

- **Architectural Planning**: Reorganizing the AB3 structure to support a multi-entity design while preserving modularity.
- **Core Feature Implementation**: Creating commands like `prescribe`, `untag`, `lastVisit`, and `delLastVisit` required model changes, storage updates, and thorough command testing.
- **Refactoring and Encapsulation**: Efforts were made to encapsulate logic (e.g., duplicate tag detection, unprescribe-all behavior), improving maintainability and scalability.
- **Testing & QA**: Over 100 test cases were written to ensure command correctness, parser robustness, and GUI functionality. Stubs such as `ClearConfirmationWindowStub` were introduced for testability.
- **Documentation**: A comprehensive [User Guide](UserGuide.md) and [Developer Guide](DeveloperGuide.md) were produced, complete with usage examples, diagrams, and manual testing instructions.

---

### Reuse and Adaptation

About **8â€“10%** of the overall development effort was saved through reuse and adaptation:

- **SE-EDUâ€™s `VersionedAddressBook`** design was used as a conceptual base for implementing undo/redo, but was customized heavily to handle `Patient` and associated nested objects.
- **JavaFX GUI classes** such as `UiPart`, `CommandBox`, and `MainWindow` were extended and customized to support contextual error messages and live-updating patient lists.
- **Diagram generation tools** and markdown structuring conventions were borrowed from SE-EDU guides and adapted to our domain-specific components (e.g., UML for `Patient`â€“`Medicine`â€“`Tag` relationships).

---

### Summary

CareConnect stands as a well-engineered, user-centered, and extensible desktop application. Compared to AB3, this project presented:
- A **higher degree of domain modeling**
- A **wider range of commands** with real-world parallels
- A **more polished and testable GUI**
- A **more rigorous input and error handling system**
- And a **scalable architecture** designed for future extensions (e.g., support for scheduling, visit history tracking)

The result is a feature-rich, production-quality CLI+GUI hybrid tailored for social workers â€” providing them with the tools to manage sensitive patient information efficiently and safely.
